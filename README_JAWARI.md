## Jawari Module v2.4.2

Jawari is a simulation of the tanpura, an Indian drone instrument. The tanpura typically has four strings, which are tuned to produce a consistent drone when plucked in order repeatedly. It is not a melodic instrument. 

The timbre of the sound made by the tanpura's strings are a function of the bridge on which they rest. The precise shape of this bridge and the "life" it gives to the sound of the strings is known as *jawari*, and is responsible for the characteristic twangy sound of the instrument. A so-called "closed" jawari gives a more traditional string instrument sound, while the more "open" the jawari is, the more buzzy and twangy it sounds. 

The jawari of the instrument can be adjusted with the main slider, open at the top and closed at the bottom. Jawari can also be modulated with the corresponding CV input which is summed with the slider position. The LED on the slider provides visual feedback of this sum. 

***Tuning***

The most common tuning of the tanpura is Pa, Sa, Sa Sa, in the Indian system, which corresponds to G, C, C, C in the key of C. The first note is usually tuned differently to match the raga which it accompanies. You can change the tuning of the first string using the "1st STRING TUNING" knob. 

The other strings will always be tuned to octaves of the root note (Sa). This root note can be transposed by semitone or by octave using the corresponding knobs. 

You can also control the tuning video the two "hidden" jacks. The jack on the left side of the module allows you to send a v/oct CV to transpose all of the strings together. The jack on the right side of the module allows you to control just the first string independently. Both of these are additive with each other and with the knobs.

***Plucking the strings***

You can pluck the strings in order manually by pressing the button under the STRUM jack. 

More typically, you will use a clock input to STRUM the strings. The tanpura sounds best when strummed slowly. A tempo around 60 BPM is a good place to start. 

Sending a trigger into RESET or pressing the RESET button will poise Jawari to strike the first string when the next STRUM comes in.
